# KMeans-and-DBScan-Clustring-On-Time-Seriese-Data
Applying the cluster validation techniques to data extracted from a provided time seriese data set.

Description:
For this project I had write a program, using Python, that takes a dataset and performs clustering. Using the provided training data set I diid : 
Perform cluster validation to determine the amount of carbohydrates in each meal.  
Test and analyze the results of the clustering code.
Assess the accuracy of the clustering using SSE and supervised cluster validity metrics.
